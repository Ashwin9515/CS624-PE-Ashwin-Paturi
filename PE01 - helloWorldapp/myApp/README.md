1. HelloWorld React Native App

## Input
The app is a React Native app created with Expo and GitHub Codespaces. It collects private information, such as the name, degree course, and user's school, which is shown using React Native's `Text` component. The project has five components: one `View`, three `Text`, and one `StyleSheet`.

## Process
The data is formatted with React Native native components. The parent is the `View` component with a yellow background color, and the `Text` components display personal information in an orderly structure. The `StyleSheet` component provides uniform styling and alignment to the layout and is used in the Expo development environment.

## Output
When executed, the app vertically renders the user's name, degree course, and institution on a yellow background. It is a basic introduction to mobile app development using React Native, incorporating component usage, layout, and styling. Its output is end-user oriented with a plain, readable, and aesthetically pleasing interface.
